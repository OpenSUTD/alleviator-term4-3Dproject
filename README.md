# Alleviator-term4-3Dproject

This project was started as part of the 2018 3D project for 30.001: Structures and Materials and 30.002: Circuits and Electronics

## Project Introduction
The tables currently available in the market are not suited to fit different user requirements simultaneously, such as the need for a standing desk for the more health-conscious or simply the need to adjust desk height to suit one’s needs. Currently, one has to use an entirely different table for a different purpose and it is inconvenient and costly for the user.  
 
Currently in the market, it is ergonomic tables and desktop attachments are costly, hence a problem that we can tackle is the high cost of ergonomic tables. Our product, Alleviator, which could clamp most table leg sizes, makes any table ergonomic and can be used to elevate the tables to the appropriate height and angle of inclination.

The concept of our product hinges on the automation of the product’s folding and unfolding, which thereafter determines the height of the table. The automation is done through the implementation of a switch system. We chose carbon fiber, a material strong enough to maintain its rigidity under stress.
