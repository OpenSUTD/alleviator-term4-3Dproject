# Alleviator-term4-3Dproject

This project was started as part of the 2018 3D project for 30.001: Structures and Materials and 30.002: Circuits and Electronics

# Term 4 3D project description

Goal: To	design,	build,	and	analyze a	gadget/device/product for	an	application	related	to	one	or	two	of	the	EPD	tracks using concepts obtained in 30.001 and 30.002. Students were	encouraged	to	use	discrete	electronic	components,	MOSFETs,	Op-amps,	R,	L,	C,	diodes,	sensors,	and	logic	chips,	e.g.	counters,	shift	registers. Students	are	discouraged	from	using	embedded	systems, e.g.	Arduino or	rely	too	heavily	on	coding.

Project timeframe: Term 4 week 5 to term 4 week 12


## Project Introduction
The tables currently available in the market are not suited to fit different user requirements simultaneously, such as the need for a standing desk for the more health-conscious or simply the need to adjust desk height to suit one’s needs. Currently, one has to use an entirely different table for a different purpose and it is inconvenient and costly for the user.  
 
Currently in the market, it is ergonomic tables and desktop attachments are costly, hence a problem that we can tackle is the high cost of ergonomic tables. Our product, Alleviator, which could clamp most table leg sizes, makes any table ergonomic and can be used to elevate the tables to the appropriate height and angle of inclination.

## Prototype

The concept of our product hinges on the automation of the product’s folding and unfolding, which thereafter determines the height of the table. The automation is done through the implementation of a switch system. We chose carbon fiber, a material strong enough to maintain its rigidity under stress.

Laser cut file attached above is the file we used to make the clamp.

## File descriptions
Here we explain what the files in our repository do.

| File        | Description           | Comments  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 3D_laser_print.dwg  | Laser cutting file used for printing of clamp and drill guide for carbon fibre square tubes | AutoCAD is used to create file. The circular parts of the file are the clamp, rectangular parts are the drill guide. Parts are to be placed together using nuts and bolts. |
